First of all it is indispensable to get the data of which countries are the ones who like to visit more often and during 
which seasson of the year(spring, winter, etc) to see if our choice is going to fit during all over the year

Once we got the ountries that fill the 80% of tourist during the year, we can investigate which are the touristic 
restaurants with more visits, and classify them according to the kind of food they serve.

We can classify later which other services this popular places offer to tourist, 
it's an hotel restauran?, bar-restaurant?, or maybe is just a very special kind of food only available in the local zone.

when we have which kind of features are the most popular between the majority of the tourist 
we can start speculate about which characteristics should our restaurant have.
